// This entry corresponds to the "stack top", which is the end of the array used as the stack for the main segment.
// It is commented out because it was not possible to infer what the start of the stack symbol is, so you'll have to figure it out by yourself.
// Once you have found it you can properly name it and specify the length of this stack as the addend value here.
// The address of the end of the stack is 0x802C3C90.
// A common size for this stack is 0x2000, so try checking for the address 0x802C1C90. Note the stack may have a different size.
